# **SQL HEROES TEMPLATE** 

## Basic project 
- Basic project must include crud functionality (Create, read, update, delete)
- I create heros through use of my create Hero function 
- I read by rendering the current table to the user by use of my renderAll function 
- I update values within the table through use of my updateHero function 
- I delete values in my table through use of my updateHero function 
- The basic project now works (Done)
